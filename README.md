Nature Sound Classification using deep learning methods

The project focuses on classifying nature sounds into nine classes using different deep learning methods. This project uses deep learning models such as VGGNet, ResNet and EfficientNet to perform nature sound classification. Also, this project applies a vanilla CNN model to the dataset and compares it with pre-trained deep learning models. 

nature_water_sounds folder consists of .wav audio files.
Proprocess_Data folder consists of time-frequency images.
prep_code1.m is matlab file which is used to convert .wav file to time-frequency images.
deep_learning_code.ipynb is the ipython file contains model implementation
